# File: `data_utils.py`

## Overview

The `data_utils.py` file is responsible for generating and preparing the dataset required for training the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Burgers' equation. This includes generating collocation points, initial condition points, and boundary condition points, which will serve as the input data for the model. The generated data is then saved as `.npy` files for further use in the training process.

## Dependencies

This file depends on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, specifically for generating random samples and manipulating arrays.
- `tensorflow`: Used to convert the generated data into tensors, which are the standard data structures for TensorFlow operations.

## Structure

The script follows these main steps:

1. **Define the Number of Points**:
   - `N_f`: Number of collocation points.
   - `N_IC`: Number of initial condition points.
   - `N_BC`: Number of boundary condition points.

2. **Define the Spatial and Time Domain**:
   - `x_min`, `x_max`: Spatial domain boundaries.
   - `t_min`, `t_max`: Time domain boundaries.

3. **Generate Points**:
   - **Collocation Points (`X_f`)**: Randomly generated within the defined spatial and time domain.
   - **Initial Condition Points (`X_IC`)**: Generated at `t=0` across the spatial domain.
   - **Boundary Condition Points (`X_BC_0`, `X_BC_1`)**: Generated at `x=0` and `x=1` across the time domain.

4. **Convert Points to Tensors**:
   - Convert all generated points to TensorFlow tensors for compatibility with the PINN model.

5. **Reshape Tensors**:
   - Reshape tensors to have two columns, representing the `x` and `t` values.

6. **Combine `x` and `t` to Create Input Tensors**:
   - Combine the reshaped tensors to form the final input data for the PINN model.

7. **Normalize Inputs**:
   - Normalize the input tensors to the range `[-1, 1]` for better model performance.

8. **Print Tensor Shapes**:
   - Print the shapes of the generated tensors to verify the data preparation process.

9. **Save Data to `.npy` Files**:
   - Save the prepared data to `.npy` files, which will be loaded during the training process.

## Potential Issues

- **Hardcoded Values**: The number of points (`N_f`, `N_IC`, `N_BC`) and domain boundaries (`x_min`, `x_max`, `t_min`, `t_max`) are hardcoded. These values could be parameterized to allow for easier experimentation.
- **Normalization**: The normalization step assumes that the data needs to be in the range `[-1, 1]`. Depending on the model, other normalization techniques might be required.

## Direction for Advancement

- **Parameterization**: Convert hardcoded values into function parameters or configuration options to make the script more flexible.
- **Validation**: Implement checks to ensure the generated data satisfies the expected physical constraints of the Burgers' equation.
- **Augmentation**: Introduce data augmentation techniques to generate a more diverse dataset, potentially improving model robustness.

## Example Output

The output of the script includes the following files saved in the `data/` directory:
- `X_f.npy`: Collocation points.
- `X_IC.npy`: Initial condition points.
- `X_BC_0.npy`: Boundary condition points at `x=0`.
- `X_BC_1.npy`: Boundary condition points at `x=1`.
- `u_IC.npy`: Initial condition values, defined as `sin(πx)`.

## Conclusion

The `data_utils.py` script plays a crucial role in preparing the data for the PINN model, ensuring that the model has the necessary input points for solving the Burgers' equation. While the script is functional, there is room for improvement in terms of flexibility and robustness, which could enhance the overall performance of the PINN model.

# File: `model.py`

## Overview

The `model.py` file is the core of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) architecture for solving the Burgers' equation. This file defines the neural network structure, a custom TensorFlow layer to compute gradients essential for the PINN approach, and utility functions for creating and loading the model as well as data.

## Dependencies

This file depends on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: Used for loading the dataset.
- `tensorflow`: Used for defining the neural network, custom layers, and model utilities.
- `tensorflow.keras`: Specifically used for building the network architecture using high-level Keras layers and models.

## Structure

The script is organized into the following main components:

1. **Network Class**:
   - The `Network` class defines a static method `build` that constructs the architecture of the neural network.
   - **Method: `build`**:
     - **Inputs**:
       - `num_inputs`: Number of input features (default is 2 for `x` and `t`).
       - `layers`: A list defining the number of neurons in each hidden layer.
       - `activation`: The activation function for the hidden layers (default is `'tanh'`).
       - `num_outputs`: Number of output neurons (default is 1).
     - **Process**:
       - The method creates an input layer followed by a series of dense layers with the specified activation function. Finally, an output layer is added with no activation function.
     - **Output**:
       - Returns a Keras `Model` object representing the neural network.

2. **GradientLayer Class**:
   - The `GradientLayer` class is a custom TensorFlow layer designed to calculate necessary gradients, which are critical for the PINN approach.
   - **Initialization**:
     - Takes a `model` as an input, which represents the neural network for which gradients will be computed.
   - **Method: `call`**:
     - **Inputs**:
       - `x`: Input tensor representing the spatial and temporal coordinates.
     - **Process**:
       - Computes the output `u` of the model.
       - Calculates the first-order gradients of `u` with respect to `t` and `x` using TensorFlow's `GradientTape`.
       - Computes the second-order gradient of `u` with respect to `x`.
     - **Output**:
       - Returns a tuple containing `u`, `du/dt`, `du/dx`, and `d²u/dx²`.
     - **Error Handling**:
       - Includes error handling to catch issues during gradient computation, printing relevant tensor shapes for debugging.
   - **Additional Methods**:
     - `summary()`: Prints the model summary.
     - `save_weights(path)`: Saves the model's weights to the specified path.
     - `load_weights(path)`: Loads the model's weights from the specified path.

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - **`create_model()`**:
     - Instantiates the neural network using the `Network.build` method and wraps it in a `GradientLayer` object.
     - Returns the `GradientLayer` object, ready to be trained and used for solving the Burgers' equation.
   - **`load_data()`**:
     - Loads the preprocessed datasets (`X_f`, `X_IC`, `X_BC_0`, `X_BC_1`, `u_IC`) from the `.npy` files.
     - Returns the loaded datasets for further processing or training.

## Potential Issues

- **Error Handling in GradientLayer**:
  - The error handling mechanism in the `call` method provides detailed information in case of failures, which is useful for debugging. However, it might be beneficial to incorporate more granular error handling to capture specific issues during gradient computation.
  
- **Hardcoded Network Architecture**:
  - The `build` method in the `Network` class uses a hardcoded default architecture. It would be advantageous to allow more flexibility in defining custom architectures.

- **Loading Large Data**:
  - The `load_data()` function assumes that the data is small enough to fit in memory. For larger datasets, consider adding support for data generators or loading data in batches.

## Direction for Advancement

- **Parameterization**:
  - Allow more flexibility in network architecture by accepting additional parameters for customization, such as different activation functions or regularization techniques.

- **Advanced Gradient Computation**:
  - Implement more sophisticated techniques for gradient computation, potentially leveraging automatic differentiation frameworks for enhanced performance and stability.

- **Model Serialization**:
  - Consider adding functionality for saving and loading the entire model architecture, not just the weights, to streamline the model deployment process.

## Example Output

The output of the `create_model()` function is a custom `GradientLayer` object that encapsulates the neural network model and provides essential gradient computations for the PINN.

## Conclusion

The `model.py` script is central to the implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network for solving the Burgers' equation. By combining a flexible neural network architecture with custom gradient computation layers, this script provides the foundation for training a model that respects the underlying physics of the problem. While the current implementation is robust, further enhancements could improve its flexibility, efficiency, and usability.

  - Implement model checkpointing to save the model's weights at regular intervals during training, allowing for recovery in case of interruptions.

## Example Output

- **Training Output**:
  - Training loss is printed at each epoch, providing real-time feedback on the model's performance.
  
- **Saved Model Weights**:
  - The trained model's weights are saved in the `results/` directory as `pinn_model.weights.h5`.

## Conclusion

## Conclusion

The `evaluation.py` script is essential for assessing the performance of the PINN model in solving the Burgers' equation. By generating test data, evaluating the model, computing residuals, and visualizing the results, this script provides a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy and adherence to the physical laws embedded in the PDE. Further enhancements could improve the depth and usability of the evaluation process.


# File: `run.py`

## Overview

The `run.py` file serves as the entry point for executing the entire workflow of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) project. This script sequentially runs the data generation, model training, and evaluation scripts, automating the process from data preparation to final model evaluation. By organizing the pipeline in a single script, it simplifies the execution and ensures that each step is performed in the correct order.

## Dependencies

This file relies on the following Python modules:
- `os`: Provides functions to interact with the operating system.
- `subprocess`: Used to run external Python scripts (`data_utils.py`, `train.py`, `evaluate.py`) as separate processes.

## Structure

The script is organized into the following main functions:

1. **Run Data Generation**:
   - **Function: `run_data_utils()`**:
     - **Process**:
       - Calls the `data_utils.py` script using the `subprocess.run()` function.
       - This step generates the training data required for the PINN model by running the `data_utils.py` script.
     - **Output**:
       - The generated data is saved to `.npy` files, which will be used in the subsequent training step.
     - **Error Handling**:
       - The `check=True` parameter ensures that the script will raise an error if the `data_utils.py` script fails to execute properly.

2. **Run Model Training**:
   - **Function: `run_train()`**:
     - **Process**:
       - Calls the `train.py` script using the `subprocess.run()` function.
       - This step trains the PINN model using the generated data by running the `train.py` script.
     - **Output**:
       - The trained model's weights are saved to a file (`pinn_model.weights.h5`) after training.
     - **Error Handling**:
       - The `check=True` parameter ensures that the script will raise an error if the `train.py` script fails to execute properly.

3. **Run Model Evaluation**:
   - **Function: `run_evaluate()`**:
     - **Process**:
       - Calls the `evaluate.py` script using the `subprocess.run()` function.
       - This step evaluates the trained PINN model and generates visualizations by running the `evaluate.py` script.
     - **Output**:
       - The evaluation results, including plots of the predicted solution and residuals, are saved as image files.
     - **Error Handling**:
       - The `check=True` parameter ensures that the script will raise an error if the `evaluate.py` script fails to execute properly.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - The `run.py` script first generates the training data, then trains the model, and finally evaluates the trained model. This ensures that all necessary steps are completed in the correct order, with each step depending on the successful completion of the previous one.

## Potential Issues

- **Error Propagation**:
  - If any of the subprocesses (`data_utils.py`, `train.py`, `evaluate.py`) fail, the `run.py` script will terminate due to the `check=True` parameter. While this is useful for catching errors, it could interrupt the workflow if not handled properly.
  
- **Dependency Management**:
  - The successful execution of the `run.py` script relies on the correct setup of the environment and the availability of all necessary files. Missing dependencies or files can cause the script to fail.

- **Execution Order**:
  - The script assumes that each step needs to be executed sequentially. If there's a need to rerun a specific step (e.g., retraining the model with new data), the script will need to be modified to accommodate that flexibility.

## Direction for Advancement

- **Modular Execution**:
  - Consider adding command-line arguments or flags to allow users to run specific steps (e.g., only data generation or only evaluation) without executing the entire pipeline.

- **Logging**:
  - Implement a logging mechanism to track the progress and output of each step, making it easier to debug issues and monitor the workflow.

- **Error Handling Enhancements**:
  - Improve error handling by providing more informative messages or recovery options if a step fails. This could include retries, skipping steps, or continuing with the next step.

## Example Output

- **Execution Flow**:
  - The script prints messages to the console to indicate the start of each step (`Generating training data...`, `Training the model...`, `Evaluating the model...`).
  
- **Generated Data**:
  - After running `data_utils.py`, the generated training data is saved to `.npy` files in the specified directory.

- **Trained Model**:
  - After running `train.py`, the trained model's weights are saved to `pinn_model.weights.h5`.

- **Evaluation Results**:
  - After running `evaluate.py`, the evaluation plots are saved as image files in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion

The `run.py` script provides a convenient way to automate the entire workflow of the PINN project, from data generation to model evaluation. By encapsulating the process in a single script, it ensures that each step is executed in the correct order, with proper error handling to catch issues early. Further enhancements could make the script more flexible and robust, allowing for easier experimentation and debugging.
